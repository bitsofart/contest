# Welcome
Welcome to our weekly community-driven automated contest that celebrates CSS craft. Our goal is to create a friendly corner on the web where challenge drives coders to inspire, entertain, and innovate, using HTML and CSS. 

For the last week winner: [csscontest.com](https://csscontest.com)

## How to win:
  1. Fork this repo.
  2. Copy the contents of the next.html file into index.html.
  3. Style it: update the styles.css file as you wish.
  4. Create a Pull Request.
  5. Be the most voted Pull Request for the week.
The PR with the most positive votes gets merged and deployed to csscontest.com, where it will stay for the whole week until the community elects a new winner. 

_Notice that editions (or additions) on the PR are not allowed._

## How to become the next week's contest content creator
The community also gets to choose the content for the competitions. The process of content selection happens in the form of issues on this repository, in two simple steps:
  1. Create an Issue with the exact HTML markup (and only that) you want to see in the coming week contest as the body.
  2. Be the most voted content suggestion for the week.
The selected content becomes part of the `next.html` file. 

_Notice that here also, editions of the main content of the issue are not allowed. The whole discussion space is free._
